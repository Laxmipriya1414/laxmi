            <h2>Why Sleep is Important?</h2>
            <p>Sleep plays a crucial role in our overall health. It helps the body repair itself, improves memory, and boosts immunity.</p>
            <p>Sleep is crucial for overall health and well-being, as it allows the body to repair and restore itself, impacting everything from cognitive function and mood to physical health; during sleep, the brain consolidates memories, the immune system strengthens, and vital hormones are released, making adequate sleep essential for optimal performance, stress management, and maintaining a healthy body weight; lack of sleep can lead to decreased concentration, irritability, impaired decision-making, and increased risk of chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease.</p>

            <h2>Tips for Better Sleep</h2>
            <p>Maintain a regular sleep schedule, avoid caffeine before bed, and keep your bedroom dark and quiet for quality sleep.</p>
            <p>To improve your sleep, establish a consistent bedtime routine, avoiding screens and blue light at least an hour before bed, keeping your bedroom cool and dark, limiting caffeine and alcohol intake close to bedtime, exercising regularly but not too close to sleep, and managing stress through relaxation techniques like meditation; if you can't fall asleep after 20 minutes, get out of bed and do a calming activity until tired, then return to bed.</p>
